1st: you need to download wamp or xampp server.


2nd: put the src code in the server folder to excute the website in your browser.


3rd: run wamp or xampp server then type "localhost/phpmyadmin" or "127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin"


4th: when you see phpmyadmin page type "root" in username box and leave the password empty and the server choice is "MySQL" then press login.


5th: now click new and create a database with the name "wg02" without any rows.


6th: and then click on "wg02" database and you will see import label click on it and choose one of the 2 sql database in this folder:- 

1- Main database is empty without any users or events or any data: if you choose this then remember to sign up for school account before the student account so the school name will appear for the student on student sign up page and he can select his school from the drop down list and after that sign into school account and authenticate this student so he can access his account and start joining campaigns.

2- Database with data: there are some users on this database so if you want to login just use "1234" password for all users and you can login by the email for school and organization but the student you can sign in by his email or his national ID.


also you can access the website by typing "localhost/VPFS" or "127.0.0.1/VPFS".
and if you want to change the name of the database other than wg02 then change it first in src code "VPFS/src/Database/connection.php"


Thank you for reading all of this and we hope and pray allah for your well-health and success.
